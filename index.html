                    <h3>What is an IP address?</h3>
                    <br>
                    An IP address is an identifier for a device that is connected to a network that uses the internet protocol. <br>It serves to route data packets across networks which allows devices to communicate with each other.<br>
                    There are two types of IP address: IPV4 and IPV6 where IPv4 is a series of numbers separated by <br> periods while IPV6 is a series of numbers and letters separated by colons. This blog will only discuss 
                    <br>IPV4 thoroughly as it is the most common type of IP address used nowadays.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What is the IPV4 notation?</h3>
                    <br>
                    An IPV4 address is a 32 binary bit address written as four numbers separated by periods.<br>
                    It is used to express the identifier of a device. The 32 bits are split into four groups <br>
                    of numbers and each group represents an 8-bit segment called an octet. When converted <br>
                    from bits to decimal, the number range in each octet is from 0 to 255.<br>
                    An example of an IPV4 address is 192.168.10.128. 
                    <br>

                    <h3>Back to IP addresses!</h3>
                    <br>
                    IP addresses consists of a network part and a host part so that networks can <br>
                    be logically broken down into smaller networks called subnets<br>
                    (smaller networks within a large network).

                <h3>What is subnetting?</h3>
                <br>
                The process of breaking one big network down into smaller networks is called subnetting.<br>
                Subnetting is achieved by changing the default subnet mask by borrowing some bits from the host portion<br>
                of an IP address to create more available networks. The default subnet mask for each IP address class are listed below:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <table class="content-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Class A</th>
                            <th>Class B</th>
                            <th>Class C</th>
                          </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>255.0.0.0</td>
                            <td>255.255.0.0</td>
                            <td>255.255.255.0</td>
                          </tr>
                    </tbody>
                    
                </table>
                <br>
                <br>
            <p>
                <h3>What is a subnet mask?</h3>
                <br>
                The subnet mask is 32 bit long. A subnet mask is assigned along with an IP address<br>
                represented in dotted decimal format. A subnet mask identifies which part of the IP address<br>
                relates to the network and which relates to the host. If we convert the decimals back into bits,
                <br> we can see which bits of the IP is allocated to the network and which are allocated to the host.<br>
                <br>
                <h4>For example:</h4>
                A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 to bits will be<br>
                11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000<br> The 1's represents the network portion
                <br>while the 0’s represents the host portion. <br>
                <br>

                    <h3>What is host address?</h3>
                    <br>
                    The host address specifies the individual device within that network.<br>
                    It represents as a unique identifier assigned to each device which can be<br>
                    obtained by taking the remaining bits of the IP address after the network<br>
                    portion has been determined. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>For example:</h4>
                    A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 to bits will be<br>
                    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000<br> The 1's represents the network portion
                    <br>while the 0’s represents the host portion. <br>

                    <h3>What is network address?</h3>
                    <br>
                    The network address specifies the network, it represents as an identifier<br>
                    for a specific network / subnet. It is obtained by applying a subnet mask<br>
                    to an IP address which determines the network segment to which the device belongs.<br>
                    <br>

                        <h3>What is CIDR?</h3>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Remember about subnet mask? It can also be expressed in a different method<br>
                            called a as CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) or slash notation.<br>
                            255.255.255.0 subnet mask if expressed to CIDR will be a /24.<br>
                            This means that the subnet mask is 24 bits in length meaning it has 24 of 1’s.<br>
                            If the subnet mask is 255.255.255.192, then the CIDR is equivalent to /26.
